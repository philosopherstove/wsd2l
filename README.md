##### Task:

Given an introductory paragraph about DNA, create a presentation to introduce high school level students to the topic.

##### Achievements:

**1) Improved Copy:**  the goal for the copy was to trim it down and, as much as possible, use only 'high value' words and sentences. All copy should either introduce or re-emphasize a core fact. Key details should be introduced at logically beneficial or appropriate times. Newly revised copy is almost 20% shorter and more contentful.

**2) Cohesive & Responsive Web Design:** designed from scratch in a sprint. Wanted a simple, cohesive look, that could work across screen sizes.

**3) Interactivity:** gamifying CRM platforms is a trend that is increasing in popularity. The inclusion of a quiz was apt for this demo. Indeed, checks on recall and knowledge should be made often on a education platform. I would further like to explore how gamified elements like a personal best record or a public competitive high-score board can improve engangement with the content.


##### Last Remark:

The demo was designed mobile-first, so the design itself is most appealing in that format. Try to view it on your phone or open a mobile view in your browsers desktop.

**Enjoy!**
